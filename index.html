<p>“Mountains are the beginning and the end of all-natural scenery”- John Ruskin. And if you ask me, I wish to stay just in between.</p>
<p>In August of 2017, I went to Tosh (another beautiful valley of Himachal). The whole village of Tosh is accessible only through the narrow alleys between the houses. At some places, stairs helped to climb up while at other sites we had to clamber up. Cow dung had taken the lanes in patches. After a while, we reached a hotel and booked a room with a terrace attached. Sitting on that terrace, under the mountains, felt like bliss already. To my left were the end of the valley and a dam right below it. The clouds and the fog approached from the right, and after a few moments, I was surrounded by it. What a welcome it was!
</p>
<p>As I explored for a decent place to eat, I saw a restaurant named after the very famous band –Pink Floyd. Pink Floyd Cafe is brilliantly located at the edge of a mountain which faces the beautiful valley of Tosh. And so, we climbed up to the cafe. It was effortlessly the best view of the valley I had experienced since we started this journey. A lot of people stayed there to see the beautiful landscape as the sun went down. So did we. While we enjoyed being surrounded by a blanket of fog, the sun rays peeked in-between the mountains, in front of us, and hit the foothill like a big spotlight and then graciously made its way to the snowy peaks. The whole experience was like being in an audience of a magic show and getting wooed by the magician. The golden light covered the valley part-by-part. The colors in the sky turned from blue to orange to pink and finally to red, a vision so divine, as I sat there on my chair admiring the work of God. God, because there was something mystical about the afterglow that evening. And with that beautiful memory, I made my way back to my home.</p>
<p>I still wonder if it was the eclipse on that day or just something about the place which made the sunset and the colors so spectacular. Whatever it may be, Tosh won my heart forthwith. Once again, Himachal proved to be magical.</p></div>
